    Butterflies are the most beautiful creatures among all insects and bugs. Butterfly has six legs, wings and two strings. The juice of flower is the only food of butterfly because butterfly can't chew anything. Female butterflies lay their eggs on flowers and leaves.Butterflies are beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings. Like all insects, they have six jointed legs, 3 body parts, a pair of antennae, compound eyes, and an exoskeleton. The three body parts are the head, thorax (the chest), and abdomen (the tail end). The butterfly's body is covered by tiny sensory hairs.Butterflies are delightful, flying insects with big flaky wings. Butterflies have a four-stage insect life cycle. The larva is the first stage.
